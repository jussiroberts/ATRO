abstract: Pharmacometabonomics, as an emerging branch of system biology, has been increasingly used in personalized medicine and showed broad prospects. By means of metabonomics, the complicated and detailed metabolic profile of the patient is described, thus providing more detailed description of the disease phenotype. With this understanding, response of different individuals to the drugs are predicted or evaluated through inherent genetic information of the individual combined with the environmental factors. As a result, appropriate drugs and dosage are chosen, which greatly promotes the realization of the individualized therapy goals. This article describes the emerging field of pharmacometabonomics, and the research results of personalized medicine based on the pharmacometabonomics in recent years are reviewed in detail.

abstract: Psychological assessment for depression, anxiety and stress among ICU patients and the patients admitted to ward in a hospital in India. This aspect did not get much attention in India so far. Such studies were common in developed countries. Therefore we decided in this study, to analyse the psychological status responses from the hospitalised patients in Mangalore using a validated questionnaire. To assess and compare the depression, anxiety and stress Scores from the patients admitted in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and those admitted to ward. Eighty patients admitted to hospital, 40 from ICU and 40 admitted to ward were recruited. They were explained the procedure and after taking an informed consent, they were administered Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale (DASS) Questionnaire, which contains 42-item questionnaire which includes three self-report scales designed to measure the negative emotional states of depression, anxiety and stress. The responses were computed and tabulated. We analysed the responses with Student's t-test and Chi-square test, p<0.05 accepted as statistically significant. The results revealed significantly elevated stress, depression and anxiety among the ICU patients when compared to those in the ward (p<0.001). Above normal anxiety and stress levels were also seen in the ward patients, compared to the scores in normal range. 50% and 25% respectively showed mild and normal depression scores in ward patients, compared to 12% and 5% in those admitted to ICU. This trend was also true for Anxiety and stress scores. From the results we found that there were elevated depression, anxiety and stress levels among the patients and this was significantly higher in ICU patients. Various factors could influence the psychological wellbeing of the patients, including the hospital environment, care givers, presence of family members nearby apart from the seriousness of illness, apprehensions about possibility of death. Such studies were rare among Indian patients. The findings of this study could be useful in incorporating suitable psychological help to the patients in hospitals to improve their recovery and wellbeing.

abstract: DNA methylation and histone modification promote opening and closure of chromatin structure, which affects gene expression without altering the DNA sequence. Epigenetic markers regulate the dynamic nature of chromatin structure at different levels: DNA, histone, noncoding RNAs, as well as the higher-order chromatin structure. Accumulating evidence strongly suggests that arsenic-induced carcinogenesis involves frequent changes in the epigenetic marker. However, progress in identifying arsenic-induced epigenetic changes has already been made using genome-wide approaches; the biological significance of these epigenetic changes remains unknown. Moreover, arsenic-induced changes in the chromatin state alter gene expression through the epigenetic mechanism. The current review provides a summary of recent literature regarding epigenetic changes caused by arsenic in carcinogenesis. We highlight the transgenerational studies needed to explicate the biological significance and toxicity of arsenic over a broad spectrum.

abstract: Early intervention and appropriate treatment in patients with GDM will help in preventing the adverse maternal and fetal outcome and protect them from long term complications. Several studies have shown the association of hyperuricemia with GDM. This study was undertaken to find out the association of elevated first trimester uric acid with development of GDM. This prospective observational study was conducted in Mahatma Gandhi Medical Collage and Research Institute, Pondicherry, India, between November 2010 and May 2012. A total of 70 pregnant women were included and parameters like age, parity, BMI, history of DM, serum uric acid at <15 weeks and at 24 to 28 weeks and one step test at 24 to 28 weeks were noted and compared. There was no significant correlation between the demographic variables and GDM, but a moderate significance noted between the family history of DM and one step test (p=0.048). Though there is a proportional increase in the serum uric acid with increase in the BMI, it was not statistically significant. A significant correlation was seen between BMI and risk of development of GDM (p= 0.001). Though there is a significant correlation between serum uric acid at <15 weeks and at 24 to 28 weeks, serum uric acid at <15 weeks of gestation is a better predictor of GGI and GDM (Pearson's correlation = 0.735). There is increase in the risk of development of GDM with increased levels of serum uric acid in the first trimester. Uric acid levels at <15 weeks of gestation is more significantly associated with risk of development of GDM than it's levels at 24 to 28 weeks of gestation.

abstract: Cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN) is one of the major complications of Diabetes Mellitus (DM) seen in a significant number of patients, which is often ignored and is also least frequently diagnosed. It can be diagnosed by performing five standard non-invasive bedside autonomic function tests based on Cardiovascular reflexes, which are quite cumbersome. Studies have revealed an increase in mortality in the diabetic patients with CAN due to silent cardiac ischemia, sudden cardiac death, arrhythmias. The precursor of diabetic cardiomyopathy is Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (LVDD). In the present study we are studying the association between LVDD and CAN, in order to identify high mortality risk patients by performing 2D Echo and looking at LVDD instead of performing the cumbersome bedside cardiovascular autonomic function tests. To study the association between LVDD and CAN in patients with Type 2 DM. This study is a cross-sectional observational study with a sample size of 100. Both outpatients and inpatients between 35 y and 65 y of age with Type 2 DM coming to Department of General Medicine, KIMS hospital, Bangalore were studied from November 2011 to October 2013.Patients with macrovascular complications, Hypertension, congenital & acquired heart diseases etc. were excluded from the study. The standard five autonomic function tests based on cardiovascular reflexes and 2D Echo were performed. Individual scores for each of the five tests were added to produce Ewing's score. Ewing's score of >2.5 is positive for CAN. Chi-square/ Fisher Exact test has been. There was a significant association between individual non-invasive bedside tests of Ewing's score and LVDD. Significant association was also seen between LVDD and positive Ewing's score. Positive Ewing's score is strongly associated with LVDD in patients with Type 2 DM in this study .This suggests that patients with LVDD have CAN and hence, are at increased risk of sudden cardiac death. As bedside tests are cumbersome, patients with LVDD on 2D Echo can be concluded to have CAN.

abstract: Plasmacytoma is a malignant disease that present either in bone marrow (medullary plasmacytoma), within the bone (solitary plasmacytoma of bone), or outside of bone, as the extramedullary plasmacytoma. Extramedullary plasmacytoma accounts for 3% of all plasma cell tumours and approximately 90% of extramedullary plasmacytomas affect the head and neck region commonly affecting the nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses, tonsillar fossa and oral cavity. Multiple extramedullary plasmacytoma is defined when there is more than one extramedullary tumour of clonal plasma cells and such presentations are extremely rare. We report such a rare case of multiple extramedullary plasmacytoma involving gingiva and neck. Here is a case report of a 65-year-old female patient presenting with extramedullary plasmacytoma of the gingiva and soft tissue in neck.

abstract: The 2 Cohort randomised PrefHer trial examined the preferences of HER2+ve primary breast cancer patients for intravenous (IV) or subcutaneous (SC) delivery of trastuzumab via a Single Injectable Device (SID) or hand-held syringe (HHS). The novel approach and design of the study permitted an in-depth exploration of patients' experiences, the impact that different modes of delivery had on patients' well-being and implications for future management. The preferences, experiences and general comments of patients in the PrefHer study were collected via specific semi-structured interview schedules. Exploratory analyses of data were conducted using standard methodology. The final question invited patients to make further comments, which were divided into 9 thematic categories - future delivery, compliments, time/convenience, practical considerations, pain/discomfort, study design, side-effects, psychological impact, and perceived efficacy. 267/467 (57%) patients made 396 additional comments, 7 were neutral, 305 positive and 86 negative. The three top categories generating the largest number of comments were compliments and gratitude about staff and being part of PrefHer (75/396; 19%), the potential future delivery of SC trastuzumab (73/396; 18%), and practical considerations about SC administration (60/396; 15%). Eliciting patient preferences about routes of administration of drugs via comprehensive interviews within a randomised cross-over trial yielded rich and important information. The few negative comments made demonstrated a need for proper staff training in SC administration Patients were grateful to have been part of the trial, and would have liked to continue with SC delivery. The possibility of home administration in the future also seemed acceptable. 2010-024099-25.

abstract: to evaluate the effects of a 12--weeks combined aerobic--resistance exercise therapy on fatigue and isokinetic muscle strength, glycemic control and health--related quality of life (HRQoL) in moderately affected type 2 diabetes (T2DM) patients. a randomized controlled trial design was employed. Forty--three T2DM patients were assigned to an exercise group (n = 22), performing 3 weekly sessions of 60 minutes of combined aerobic--resistance exercise for 12--weeks; or a no exercise control group (n = 21). Both groups were evaluated at a baseline and after 12--weeks of exercise therapy for: 1) muscle strength and fatigue by isokinetic dynamometry; 2) plasma glycated hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C); and 3) HRQoL utilizing the SF--36 questionnaire. the exercise therapy led to improvements in muscle fatigue in knee extensors (--55%) and increased muscle strength in knee flexors and extensors (+15 to +30%), while HbA1C decreased (--18%). In addition, the exercising patients showed sizeable improvements in HRQoL: physical function (+53%), vitality (+21%) and mental health (+40%). 12--weeks of combined aerobic--resistance exercise was highly effective to improve muscle strength and fatigue, glycemic control and several aspects of HRQoL in T2DM patients. These data encourage the use of aerobic and resistance exercise in the good clinical care of T2DM.

Coronary angiography revealed severe stenosis from the ostium of the left main coronary artery (LMCA) to the left anterior descending artery (LAD). Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) identified a large hematoma that originated from the aorta and extended into the LAD, thereby compressing the true lumen. Type A aortic dissection (TAAD) that involved the LMCA was diagnosed by IVUS. Coronary stenting was performed via the LMCA to the proximal LAD, which resulted in coronary blood flow restoration and no further propagation of dissection. Elective surgical aortic repair was performed 2 wk after the stenting. LMCA stenting under IVUS guidance is effective for prompt diagnosis and precise stent deployment in patients with cardiogenic shock due to TAAD with LMCA dissection.

abstract: Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the periodontal tissues causing periodontal attachment loss and destruction of the alveolar bone which leads to mobility and loss of teeth. Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Aa) is a gram negative, capnophilic, coccobacillus that plays an important role in aggressive Periodontitis. Aa produces a variety of virulence factors that facilitate the colonization, invasion and destruction of the periodontal tissues. Leukotoxin and cytolethal distending toxin (Cdt) are most important virulence factors of Aa. The three dimensional structure of leukotoxin was derived by Easy modeller software and Cdt was retrieved from RCSB database. The possible binding sites of toxins were searched using binding site prediction tool Q site finder. A total of 1000 ligands of flavanol derivatives were generated with the help of software ACD chemsketch. Rapid virtual screenings of these compounds were performed in the docking tool iGEMDOCK v2.0. Based on the binding energy, six ligands were selected for the further study. The selected six ligands were then analysed for drug relevant properties based on "Lipinski's rule of five" and other drug like properties. The accurate docking of six ligands was performed using docking tool iGEMDOCK v2.0. From the present study, it has been found that carboxyl {(2R,3R)-3,7 dihydroxy 4-oxo-2(3,4,5-trihydroxyphenyl)-3,4-dihydro2H-chromen-5-yl} oxonium, which is a novel compound can effectively act as an inhibitor for both the toxins. The leucotoxin and cytolethal distending toxin of Aa is found to be the major virulence factors involved in the causation of aggressive periodontitis. Hence the inhibitors of these toxins can be an effective drug in treatment of aggressive periodontitis.

abstract: The aim of this study was to know the addiction to training and the relationship between this and the intrinsic satisfaction, perceptions and beliefs about the causes of success in their sport in a heterogeneous sample of 401 Spanish master athletes (over 35 years of age) who completed the questionnaire electronically. Also, get sufficiently robust predictive models, by sex, of their addiction according to these psychological variables. On one hand, it was found that addiction to training was moderate in men and women, and being cause from different causes than in other populations of athletes. On the other, that it was predicted by high ego orientation and/or low task orientation. In addition, each of the less desirable subscales of addiction (tolerance, lack of control and abstinence and craving), although with significant differences by sex, were usually predicted by the also less desirable subscales of intrinsic satisfaction, perception and beliefs on the causes for success. By contrast, the most desirable subscale of addiction (pleasure and relaxation), although predicted by the most desirable and positive subscale of intrinsic satisfaction (fun), there was no gender matching in the prediction by the subscales of perceived beliefs on the causes for success. These data, taken all-together, indicates that their training addiction should be treated fostering task orientation and fun, while trying to reduce as far much as possible ego orientation.

abstract: Influenza is considered as an emerging disease until today. The present study was undertaken to determine the prevalent genotypes of Influenza A virus in Malaysia. Influenza A virus was identified from respiratory specimens by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). Phylogenetic analysis of the identified isolates was performed and genotypes were detected. A total number of 505 throat swabs and nasopharyngeal aspirates were examined by rRT-PCR at Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre (UKMMC) in which 65(12.87%) were positive for influenza A. The identified isolates were successfully genotyped by phylogenetic analysis. The identified influenza A genotypes were: H1N1 (42), H3N2 (20) and H5N1 (3). The findings indicated that 3 genotypes were circulating in Malaysia during 2011 in which H1N1 was the predominant. RESULTS added new genotype (H5N1) identification record in Malaysia that may be added in data base of WHO and CDC.

abstract: Intraoral film placement and the film holding equipments are not acceptable by many due to varied reasons. To evaluate the utility of extra-oral aiming device developed by Chia-hui chen for imaging the periapical regions of posterior teeth employing the technique suggested by saberi et al. The study subjects included 20 patients in the age group of 10-35 y. The subjects were further subdivided according to the area to be imaged into four groups, with 5 in each. Imaging was done using the device developed by chia-hui chen, with the method employed by newmann and saberi et al., The radiographs were then interpreted for complete coverage of the anatomical structure. The findings were recorded and subjected to Analysis of variance (ANOVA) statistical analysis. The visibility of imaging area was more in mandible (95%) than maxilla (86.5%). The overall accuracy was 90.75%. These findings were statistically non-significant (F- 2.152 & P-0.134). Among the reason for reduced accuracy, overlapping of the opposite arch (4%) was more common and the horizontal overlapping (0.5%) was least common. This technique is not meant to replace conventional intraoral radiography. It is a useful supplementary aid to our clinical practice.

abstract: Oral mucositis (ulcer) is a serious and painful side effect for patients with head and neck cancer following radiation therapy. However, current clinical strategies cannot efficiently prevent the occurrence of oral mucositis. In this study, we investigated whether bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs) prevented the occurrence and/or decreased the severity of radiation-induced oral mucositis. Fresh concentrated BMDCs from male C3H mice were transplanted intravenously into female mice after tongue irradiation. For 14 days postirradiation, the changes of body weight and the time courses of ulceration were observed. Until the ulcer reached maximum size (7 days postirradiation), macroscopic and histologic analyses of harvested tongues were performed to detect the behavior of donor BMDCs. Between 2 and 5 days postirradiation, BMDCs-transplanted mice showed more expression of stem cell markers (c-Kit, Sca-1) and EGFR and fewer apoptotic cells when compared with nontransplanted control mice (irradiation group). On day 7, there were fewer and smaller ulcers observed in the BMDCs-transplanted group. Tongues of these mice had preserved their epithelial thickness, and regenerative activities (blood vessels formation, cell proliferation) were higher than they were in the irradiation group. Fluorescently labeled BMDCs were not detected in tongue epithelium but rather in connective tissue (dermis) just below the basal cell layer. These findings suggest that exogenous BMDCs behave to reduce radiogenic oral mucositis in a paracrine manner.

abstract: To report a new spectral domain optical coherence tomography finding of retinal herniation in a patient with macular detachment accompanying peripapillary detachment in pathologic myopia. Retrospective case report. A 47-year-old male patient with pathologic myopia and peripapillary detachment, pitlike defect, and associated macular detachment. Spectral domain optical coherence tomography scan showed intrachoroidal cavitation, discontinuity of retinal layers over the pitlike defect with herniation of retinal tissue through which communication between the choroidal cavity and subretinal space was seen. We report for the first time retinal herniation through pitlike dehiscence in pathologic myopia with intrachoroidal cavitation, and describe its association with macular detachment.

abstract: Invasive infections from community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) are increasingly being encountered in healthy children. Nasal colonization of MRSA is associated with increased risk for acquiring invasive disease. The objective of this study was to determine prevalence and risk factors for CA-MRSA nasal colonization among a healthy paediatric population and to determine antibiotic susceptibilities of S. aureus isolates. Using a cross-sectional study design, children aged 1mnth-17y attending well-child clinic at an academic hospital and a local public school in Mangalore, India were screened for S. aureus colonization via nasal swabs. A questionnaire was administered and data on risk factors for nasal colonization was collected. Samples were obtained from the anterior nares and cultured quantitatively. S. aureus isolates were confirmed by growth on selective media and coagulase testing. Disk diffusion antibiotic susceptibility tests were performed according to Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute guidelines. Of the 500 children included in the study, S. aureus was isolated from the anterior nares in 126 (25%) children; four (3%) isolates were classified as CA-MRSA. Factors associated with S. aureus nasal colonization were children <6 y old (p=0.030) and members of joint families (p=0.044). Resistance to many classes of antibiotics were noted among S. aureus isolates including trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (39%), ciprofloxacin (16%), erythromycin (19%) and clindamycin (5%). Inducible clindamycin resistance (positive D test) was detected in 11 of the erythromycin-resistant strains not already classified as resistant to clindamycin. No resistance to vancomycin was observed. Children in India have a high rate of nasal colonization of S. aureus. Nasal colonization of community-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus exists but is still low among healthy children. The high rate of resistance to many classes of antibiotics among S. aureus strains is of great concern warranting continued surveillance and antimicrobial stewardship.

abstract: Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) constitute a group of soft tissue neoplasms with neurogenic origin. Association of MPNST with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) has been frequently reported as a result of malignant transformation of a pre-existing plexiform neurofibroma. However, most of the cases are small and few have been described with giant dimensions. We describe a case of a giant MPNST in an unusual location (scalp), in a NF1 patient. A fifty-six years old woman with a history of NF1 since childhood was admitted due to a rapid growing of a scalp tumor in occipital region. The mass had 15 cm in the largest dimension and a central ulceration with purulent secretion. Computed tomography revealed no bone invasion. The tumor was surgically removed and the histopathological examination revealed a neurofibrosarcoma. The patient had a good post operatory evolution and notwithstanding the tumor size, no metastasis was found and she was discharged to oncologic follow-up. Given the poor prognosis of MPNST, patients with NF1 should be aware that neurofibromas can undergo malignant transformation and report signs such as rapid growth of a pre-existing lesion.
